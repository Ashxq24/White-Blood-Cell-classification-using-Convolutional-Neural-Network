# White-Blood-Cell-classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Recent years have seen a rise in the use of deep learning techniques in the medical field. This fact motivates us to classify the WBC in the supplied blood sample using deep learning techniques. To determine the type of WBC, a convolution neural network (CNN) is developed and a classifier is also built.
