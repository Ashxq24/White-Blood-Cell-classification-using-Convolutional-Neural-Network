Recent years have seen a rise in the use of deep learning techniques in the medical field. This fact motivates us to classify the WBC in the supplied blood sample using deep learning techniques.

To determine the type of WBC, a convolution neural network (CNN) is developed and a classifier is also built. 

The below points are this paper's main contributions:

1. To identify the different types of WBC in the provided blood sample, a classification approach based on convolution neural networks is developed.

2. The Blood Cell Count and Classification Dataset is used to assess the suggested approach.

3. The specificity, accuracy and sensitivity of the proposed technique's performance are compared to those of four well used procedures.

When compared to other classifiers, the suggested CNN's overall accuracy in classifying the kind of WBC is 91.55%. 

The suggested CNN was created from the ground up and has a 91.55% accuracy rate after 20 epochs. Other classification issues, including RBC classification, can be resolved using the suggested CNN-based classification approach. 

To increase accuracy rates, transfer learning strategies can also be used. The suggested CNN model does, however, provide an overall accuracy rate of more than 91.55%.
